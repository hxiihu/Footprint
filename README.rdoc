SCOPE OF THE PROJECT / IDEATION

Our project aims to provide a website to record, represent and share travellers’ routes, photos and travelogue. We are aiming for Project Gemini.

MOTIVATION

Many people are travelling enthusiasts. At the end of the day, travellers want to record their travel including the photos they took, travelogue they wrote and the places they’ve been to.

If travellers wants to do this, they may use Google Map or MapBox to label the places they’ve been to, or upload photos to Instagram with information of locations so that they can view their photos on a world map, or they may write travelogue on their own blogs and include their photos.

But these solutions have their own limitations. Google Map has many limitations or very hard to include all the information travellers want to include and organise them nicely.

Our project hope to provide a one-stop solution that can record travelling information (e.g. photos, locations, routes, travelogues) and represent nicely.

More features will be shown in User story part. yes it is. PROPOSED LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT

Gemini is our primary goal. May be re-evaluated to Apollo 11.
